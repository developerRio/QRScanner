# QRScanner
A sample application to scan &amp; read QR codes (Using Firebase' ML Kit). Yes the UI is sort of looking like Google Lense(used bottom 
sheet instead). Works pretty much good, it also saves the scanned QR codes with information into phone's memory(Used Android Jetpack's Room)
for the camera I used cameraKit instead of camer2API, because for sharper & a little bit enhanced picture.
